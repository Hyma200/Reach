# Virtual Volunteer
An Android application that provides a platform for organizations to connect to volunteers and vice versa.

## A convenient communication space for volunteers and organizers
Organizers can post details on the volunteer opportunity and see who is interested in helping. Volunteers can browse through opportunities and view details regarding the organization, date, time, location, requirements, and responsibilities, and indicate whether they are interested in helping out. Organizers will then be notified of their interest and can view the person's profile and contact information. Application also allows for users to track their hours and organizations that they've worked for.

## Volunteer profile pages
Volunteers can share their personality and contributions through their profile that includes their name, picture, location, number of hours volunteered, and organizations that they have helped out.
