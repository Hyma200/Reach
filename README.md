# VirtualVolunteer
A mobile app for Android that provides a platform for organizations who need volunteers and people who are looking for volunteer opportunities. 

## A convenient communication space for volunteers and organizers
Organizers can post details on the volunteer opportunity and see who is interested in helping. Volunteers can browse and search for different types of opportunities and view details regarding the organization, date, time, location, requirements, and responsibilities, and indicate that they are interested in helping out. Organizers will then be notified of their interest and can view the person's profile and contact information.

## Volunteer profile pages
Volunteers can share their personality and contributions through their profile that includes their name, picture, location, number of hours volunteered, and organizations that they have helped out.
